`fusion` is a [`liquidsoap`](https://www.liquidsoap.info) server that fuses music from playlists and live audio and sends one output stream to broadcast servers.

## Usage

To start the server make sure you have [`liquidsoap`](https://www.liquidsoap.info) installed, then `cd` into `src` and run:

```sh
liquidsoap fusion.liq
```

Right after starting it will starting streaming songs from the embedded playlist,
but you can connect with [`SRT`](https://www.haivision.com/products/srt-secure-reliable-transport/) to [`http://localhost:9000`](http://localhost:9000) and send your own audio.

## Output

Currently, `fusion` supports sending the output only to an [Icecast](https://icecast.org) server (nicknamed `decay` here).
You need to provide some info about it using environmental variables:

- `DECAY_HOST` - address of the host where the Icecast server is running
- `DECAY_PORT` - port at which the Icecast server is listening
- `DECAY_SOURCE_PASSWORD` - password used for accessing Icecast
- `DECAY_MOUNT` - mount point
